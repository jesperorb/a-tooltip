# a-tooltip

_A small hopefully `ARIA`-compliant tooltip-component_

> A tooltip is a popup that displays information related to an element
when the element receives keyboard focus or the mouse hovers over it.
It typically appears after a small delay and disappears when Escape
is pressed or on mouse out.

>Tooltip widgets do not receive focus.
A hover that contains focusable elements can be made using a non-modal dialog.

>The element that serves as the tooltip container has role tooltip.
The element that triggers the tooltip references the tooltip element with aria-describedby.
